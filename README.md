## oscillator crystal(isnt/wasnt/arent this for voltage synchronization?)

An oscillator crystal is a piezoelectric material or vibrating crystal that generates an electrical signal at a precise frequency in an electronic circuit

## piezoelectric

the shoes that flashes when you step on something

mechanical energy -> electrical energy -> light energy

## Ouch

How you get bruised -> how you get shocked -> how you get sunburn
